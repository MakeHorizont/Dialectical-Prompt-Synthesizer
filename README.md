## 🧠 The Concept

Logic Lab is designed for professional prompt engineers who prioritize structure, logic, and efficiency. Instead of relying on random "hacks," Logic Lab utilizes a systemic iterative process to evolve your requirements:

1.  **Concept (Initial Draft):** Define your core objective and baseline requirements.
2.  **Analysis (Review):** The AI analyst audits the concept for missing parameters, edge cases, and structural weaknesses, producing a robust analytical foundation.
3.  **Synthesis (Modular Output):** Both inputs are integrated into a production-ready system prompt using strict schemas (XML, TypeScript, COSTAR, etc.).

## ⚡ Key Features

*   **Systemic Iteration:** Evolve prompts through automated critical review.
*   **Modular Construction:** Drag-and-drop builder for structured prompt assets.
*   **Global Localization:** Full support for 5 major languages with context-aware translation.
*   **Reliable Translation Engine:** A fail-safe chain of 6 translation providers ensures continuous operation.
*   **Export/Import:** Save and load full project archives in JSON format.
*   **AI Logic:** Powered by Google Gemini 3 Pro models for advanced reasoning and synthesis.

## 🛠️ Setup

1.  **Clone the project**
    ```bash

    cd logic-lab
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API Access**
    *   Rename `env.example.txt` to `.env`.
    *   Add your Gemini API Key.
    ```text
    VITE_API_KEY=your_key_here
    ```

4.  **Launch**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
